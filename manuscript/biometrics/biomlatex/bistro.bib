abstract = {The Minimum Evolution (ME) approach to phylogeny estimation has been shown to be statistically consistent when it is used in conjunction with ordinary least-squares (OLS)  tting of a metric to a tree structure. The traditional approach to using ME has been to start with the Neighbor Joining (NJ) topology for a given matrix and then do a topological search from that starting point. The  rst stage requires O(n3) time, where n is the number of taxa, while the current implementations of the second are in O(p n3) or more, where p is the number of swaps performed by the program. In this paper, we examine a greedy approach to minimum evolution which produces a starting topology in O(n2) time. Moreover, we provide an algorithm that searches for the best topology using nearest neighbor interchanges (NNIs), where the cost of doing p NNIs is O(n2 C p n), i.e., O(n2) in practice because p is always much smaller than n. The Greedy Minimum Evolution (GME) algorithm, when used in combination with NNIs, produces trees which are fairly close to NJ trees in terms of topological accuracy. We also examine ME under a balanced weighting scheme, where sibling subtrees have equal weight, as opposed to the standard “unweighted” OLS, where all taxa have the same weight so that the weight of a subtree is equal to the number of its taxa. The balanced minimum evolution scheme (BME) runs slower than the OLS version, requiring O(n2 {\pounds} diam(T)) operations to build the starting tree and O(p n {\pounds} diam(T)) to perform the NNIs, where diam(T) is the topological diameter of the output tree. In the usual Yule-Harding distribution on phylogenetic trees, the diameter expectation is in log(n), so our algorithms are in practice faster that NJ. Moreover, this BME scheme yields a very signi cant improvement over NJ and other distance-based algorithms, especially with large trees, in terms of topological accuracy.},

Associate editor: Michael Rosenberg Abstract FastME provides distance algorithms to infer phylogenies. FastME is based on balanced minimum evolution, which is the very principle of Neighbor Joining (NJ). FastME improves over NJ by performing topological moves using fast, sophisti- cated algorithms. The first version of FastME only included Nearest Neighbor Interchange. The new 2.0 version also includes Subtree Pruning and Regrafting, while remaining as fast as NJ and providing a number of facilities: Distance estimation for DNA and proteins with various models and options, bootstrapping, and parallel computations. FastME is available using several interfaces: Command-line (to be integrated in pipelines), PHYLIP-like, and a Web server (http:// www.atgc-montpellier.fr/fastme/).},

abstract = {In this article I introduce the idea of conditional independence of separated subtrees as a principle by which to estimate the posterior probability of trees using conditional clade probability distributions rather than simple sample relative frequencies. I describe an algorithm for these calculations and software which implements these ideas. I show that these alternative calculations are very similar to simple sample relative frequencies for high probability trees but are substantially more accurate for relatively low probability trees. The method allows the posterior probability of unsampled trees to be calculated when these trees contain only clades that are in other sampled trees. Furthermore, the method can be used to estimate the total probability of the set of sampled trees which provides a measure of the thoroughness of a posterior sample.},

abstract = {The minimum-evolution (ME) method of phylogenetic inference is based on the assumption that the tree with the smallest sum of branch length estimates is most likely to be the true one. In the past this assumption has been used without mathematical proof. Here we present the theoretical basis of this method by showing that the expectation of the sum of branch length estimates for the true tree is smallest among all possible trees, provided that the evolutionary distances used are statistically unbiased and that the branch lengths are estimated by the ordinary least-squares method. We also present simple mathematical formulas for computing branch length estimates and their standard errors for any unrooted bifurcating tree, with the least-squares approach. As a numerical example, we have analyzed mtDNA sequence data obtained by Vigilant et al. and have found the ME tree for 95 human and 1 chimpanzee (outgroup) sequences. The tree was somewhat different from the neighbor-joining tree constructed by Tamura and Nei, but there was no statistically significant difference between them.},

@article{Gascuel1997,
abstract = {We propose an improved version of the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm of Saitou and Nei. This new algorithm, BIONJ, follows the same agglomerative scheme as NJ, which consists of iteratively picking a pair of taxa, creating a new mode which represents the cluster of these taxa, and reducing the distance matrix by replacing both taxa by this node. Moreover, BIONJ uses a simple first-order model of the variances and covariances of evolutionary distance estimates. This model is well adapted when these estimates are obtained from aligned sequences. At each step it permits the selection, from the class of admissible reductions, of the reduction which minimizes the variance of the new distance matrix. In this way, we obtain better estimates to choose the pair of taxa to be agglomerated during the next steps. Moreover, in comparison with NJ's estimates, these estimates become better and better as the algorithm proceeds. BIONJ retains the good properties of NJ--especially its low run time. Computer simulations have been performed with 12-taxon model trees to determine BIONJ's efficiency. When the substitution rates are low (maximum pairwise divergence approximately 0.1 substitutions per site) or when they are constant among lineages, BIONJ is only slightly better than NJ. When the substitution rates are higher and vary among lineages,BIONJ clearly has better topological accuracy. In the latter case, for the model trees and the conditions of evolution tested, the topological error reduction is on the average around 20{\%}. With highly-varying-rate trees and with high substitution rates (maximum pairwise divergence approximately 1.0 substitutions per site), the error reduction may even rise above 50{\%}, while the probability of finding the correct tree may be augmented by as much as 15{\%}.},

@article{Rzhetsky1992,
abstract = {A simple method for estimating and testing phylogenetic trees under the principle of minimum evolution (ME) is presented. The basic procedure of this method is first to obtain the neighbor-joining (NJ) tree by Saitou and Nei's method and then to search for a tree with the minimum value of the sum (S) of branch lengths by examining all trees that are closely related to the NJ tree. Once the ME tree is identified, a statistical test is conducted for the difference in S between this tree and other closely related trees. The mathematical method required for conducting this test is developed by using the least-squares approach. Computer simulation has shown that this method identifies the correct tree with a high probability, as long as the number of nucleotides examined is sufficiently large. It has also been shown that the topology of the NJ tree is almost always identical with that of the ME tree. A method for obtaining least-squares estimates (and their standard errors) of branch lengths for a given topology is also presented. This method can be used for testing the reliability of the branching pattern of the ME tree. However, the statistical test of S values is more powerful in rejecting incorrect trees than is the branch-length test or bootstrapping. Furthermore, both a mathematical method for computing the number of trees with a given value of topological difference from the NJ tree and a computer algorithm for identifying all the topologies are developed.},
